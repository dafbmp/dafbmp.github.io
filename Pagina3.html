      <h2>SportBikes</h2>
      <div style="height:187px;"><div class="ImgSportBikes"></div></div>
      <div class="FullFaceText">
      <p>A sport bike (sports motorcycle, or sports bike) is a motorcycle designed and optimized for speed, acceleration, braking, and cornering on asphalt concrete race tracks and roads. They are mainly designed for performance at the expense of comfort, fuel economy, and storage in comparison with other motorcycles.</p>

      <h2>Dirt bikes</h2>
      <div style="height:150px;"><div class="ImgDirtbikesS"></div></div>
      <div class="FullFaceText">
      <p>Off-road motorcycles, also known as dirt bikes or scramblers, specially designed for off-road use. The term off-road refers to driving surfaces that are not conventionally paved. These are rough surfaces, often created naturally, such as sand, gravel, a river, mud or snow. These types of terrain can sometimes only be travelled on with vehicles designed for off-road driving.</p>

      <h2>Standard</h2>
      <div style="height:150px;"><div class="ImgStandard"></div></div>
      <div class="FullFaceText">
      <p>Standard motorcycles (also called naked bikes, roadsters, or simply standards) are motorcycles mainly intended for use on streets for commuting. They are characterized primarily by their upright riding position.</p>

      <h2>Dual-purpose</h2>
      <div style="height:150px;"><div class="ImgDual-purpose"></div></div>
      <div class="FullFaceText">
      <p>Dual-purpose motorcycles, sometimes called dual-sport, on/off-road motorcycles, or adventure motorcycles, are street legal machines that are also designed to enter off-road situations. Typically based on a dirt bike chassis, they have added lights, mirrors, signals, and instruments that allow them to be licensed for public roads. They are higher than other street bikes, with a high center of gravity and tall seat height, allowing good suspension travel for rough ground.</p>

      <h2>Cruiser</h2>
      <div class="fakeimg32" style="height:170px;"><div class="ImgCruiser"></div></div>
      <div class="FullFaceText">
      <p>Cruiser motorcycles (or simply cruisers) are styled after American motorcycles from the 1930s to the early 1960s, such as those made by Harley-Davidson, Indian, and Excelsior-Henderson. Harley-Davidsons largely define the cruiser category, and large-displacement V-twin engines are the norm, although other engine configurations and small to medium displacements also exist.</p>

      <h2>Touring</h2>
      <div class="fakeimg42" style="height:150px;"><div class="ImgTouring"></div></div>
      <div class="FullFaceText">
      <p>Although any motorcycle can be equipped and used for touring, touring motorcycles are specifically designed to excel at covering long distances. They have large-displacement engines, fairings and screens that offer good weather and wind protection, large-capacity fuel tanks for long ranges between fill-ups, and a relaxed, upright seating position.</p>
